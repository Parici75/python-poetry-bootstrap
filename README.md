# Python Poetry bootstrap template
> *Author: [Benjamin Roland](https://www.github.com/parici75)*


This repository contains the backbone, configuration and `make` targets to set up a repeatable Python development environment with Poetry.

For additional context, read the accompanying [blog post](https://benjaminroland.onrender.com/coding&data/migrating-to-poetry).

## üö¶ Requirements
Make sure you have Poetry installed on your system (see [instruction](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installing-with-the-official-installer)).

Then, assuming you have a Unix shell with `make`, use the following target to set up a new Poetry-managed replicable environment for your project :
```bash
make init
```

## üë∑ CI/CD tools we use
- üöÄ Package management tool: [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/)
- üé≠ Code formatting: [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/index.html) to tidy code and imports.
- ‚úÖ Code quality: [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/)
- üß™ Tests: [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/)
- üì§ [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hooks


All tools configurations are gathered on a single `pyproject.toml` TOML file.


## üîñ Dynamic Versioning
We use [poetry-dynamic-versioning](https://github.com/mtkennerly/poetry-dynamic-versioning) to enforce VCS tags as a single source of truth for project versioning.


## üì§ Pre-commit hooks
Pre-commit hooks prevent code with identified issues to be committed and submitted for code review.
We use :
- [built-in](https://pre-commit.com/hooks.html) pre-commit hooks for common linting/code quality checks.
- [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) to keep up with PEP syntax upgrade.
- [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/index.html) for proper code formatting.
- [Ruff](https://beta.ruff.rs/docs/) and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) hooks to catch code quality issues early.


## üìù Documentation
The template ships with a pre-built documentation structure for [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/), with [Autodoc](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) extension and the neat [Furo](https://github.com/pradyunsg/furo) them. Use the `update-doc` make target to populate documentation source, and adapt the `index.rst` and `conf.py` files as needed.

Use a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/peaceiris/actions-gh-pages) to deploy the documentation on GitHub Pages (see example [here](https://github.com/Parici75/statsplotly/blob/main/.github/workflows/sphinx.yml)).


## üî© Dissecting Makefile
The Makefile provides several targets to assist in development and code quality :
- `init` creates a project-specific virtual environment and installs the dependencies of the `.lock` file, if present (see [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/basic-usage/#installing-dependencies) for an intro on Poetry `.lock` file).
- `ci` launches black, ruff, mypy and pytest on your source code.
- `pre-commit` set up and/or update pre-commit hooks (see pre-commit [documentation](https://pre-commit.com/)) and run them on all your *staged* files.
- `coverage` run tests under coverage and produces a [coverage report](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/7.5.0/).
- `update-doc` and `build-doc` updates and builds your documentation with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) for local previsualisation.
- `clean` clears bytecode, poetry/pip caches, and pre-commit hooks. Use with caution.


## üöõ Adapting and Extending this template
- Python version and dependencies are listed in and can be added to the `pyproject.toml` file manually or with the `poetry add` [command](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#add)
- For application deployment, add [dockerization](https://github.com/orgs/python-poetry/discussions/1879#).
- Poetry exposes [methods](https://python-poetry.org/docs/cli/#publish) for struggleless publishing of your package on [PyPi](https://pypi.org/).
- For CI/CD, GitHub Actions need to be set up to check commits and trigger different build (see example [here](https://github.com/Parici75/statsplotly/tree/main/.github/workflows)).
